       "'Facebook posts shared in at least three countries as scientists work to develop a COVID-19 vaccine claim to offer a legal way to refuse vaccination. Wisconsin is clearly seeing a decline in COVID infections. Facebook posts claim a child who is infected with the novel coronavirus will be taken to a hospital unaccompanied. Indias Ministry of Home Affairs banning citizens from posting about the new coronavirus on social media. 42 Democratic senators, plus two Independents, voted against sending direct payments to Americans as part of the coronavirus economic stimulus package. The photo of a vaccine for canine coronavirus proves that a vaccine exists for the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. A picture of a reporter in protective medical gear is an example of how the American media hypes the COVID-19 pandemic. A photo taken by a journalist showing a beach in Jacksonville, Florida, isnt from after the government reopened the beach as news reports have claimed. News photo from stay-at-home protest was doctored to add Confederate flag. Says a photo shows the SAME EXACT PEOPLE at two different beaches in Los Angeles County and Jacksonville, Florida. My wife is suffering from coronavirus and she is pregnant. The doctor said she wont survive it. A Democratic attack ad said Trump shipped 17 tons of medical supplies to China. The COVID-19 virus cannot spread in areas sprayed with eucalyptus oil vapor. Goodwill Industries International has fired all its employees because of the coronavirus pandemic. Says Wisconsins in-person election has caused a surge in new coronavirus cases Nobel laureate Luc Montagnier claimed that the coronavirus genome contained sequences of HIV (the virus that causes AIDS). Trumps claim that Obamas handling of the 2009 swine flu pandemic was a disaster. \"House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi posted and deleted a video on her Twitter account, in which she calls on people to visit Chinatown in San Francisco.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi delete a February 24, 2020, video of herself from Twitter in which she encouraged people to visit Chinatown in San Francisco. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized Bodyspheres two-minute COVID-19 testing kit. Posts shared more than 2,000 times on social media appear to show a 2009 tweet from Donald Trump criticizing then-president Barack Obamas handling of the H1N1 pandemic and placing ALL responsibility on presidents in a crisis. Amazons Alexa says the government released the coronavirus. In the United States, there are 360,000 (deaths) a year from swimming pools. But we dont shut the country down for that. Hospitals compensated 15% more for COVID-19 patients under the stimulus package and New York City hospitals are inflating their coronavirus numbers. A video argues that the pandemic could have resulted from the accidental or intentional release of either a natural virus under study or an artificial virus that was bioengineered (manmade). Says Democrats are on vacation until May 4 and refuse to come back to sign a bill to help small businesses. This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, folks. And so you would think the people charged with the World Health Organization facts and figures would be on top of that. Thieves are handing out chemically doused face masks to knock people out before robbing them. Economic stimulus payments to U.S. citizens will either reduce future tax refunds or will have to be paid back. Valley County, Montana, mandated pink arm bands for residents who had submitted to quarantine protocol. Gov. Andrew Cuomo was simply saying if we can share 20 percent of your excess, your non-used ventilators, to help people in other parts of the state on a voluntary basis, that would be great. Of course, there was a reaction to that, which was not positive. Trumps claims about how quickly WHO acted to announce human-to-human transmission Video shows an orangutan who started washing its hands after watching the zookeepers do so during the coronavirus pandemic. The news media has tried to pass off one mans death, attributed to complications from COVID-19, as two separate cases. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer bans buying US flags during lockdown. The president looks like he was ahead of the curve  as you know, he talks about this all the time  on shutting down travel from China. Joe Diffies death was labeled as a COVID-19 death and it wasnt! Trump says that as president he has total authority to re-open states amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Average American has less than two-tenths of one percent chance of getting coronavirus, and thus public health officials overreacted to the pandemic.

There is no second wave of COVID-19; this second wave is really just the normal flu/common cold season that happens every year Genetic evidence within the Spike gene of the SARS-CoV-2 genome suggest that the virus is a product of genetic manipulation Cloth masks cannot block smoke particles which are larger than viruses, so masks cannot stop the spread of the virus PGA golfer Bubba Wallace wrote Facebook post that criticizes measures taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The World Integrated Trade Solutions (WITS) website shows that COVID-19 test kits were being sold in 2017 and 2018 COVID-19 case numbers in the U.S. are inflated due to the high sensitivity of the RT-PCR diagnostic test'"

everywhere you go. Two-thirds of Americans disapprove of Donald Trump not wearing a face mask in public. Research illustrates a clear correlation between vitamin D deficiencies and (higher) COVID-19 mortality rates. Infection rates in Allegany, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties have consistently been among the lowest in the state. In COVID-19 crisis only 20% of African Americans had jobs where they could work from home. Significantly more people died of Covid-19 in two months than died of overdoses all of last year or the year before. Says President Trump said coronavirus testing makes the U.S. look bad, \"so I said to my people, Slow the testing down.\" \"North Carolina is one of four states\" that hasn\\'t opened gyms. Says Wisconsin measures have \"prevented the death of at least 300 Wisconsinites and perhaps as many as 1400 lives.\" Congressional candidate Chris Jacobs voted against paid leave for COVID-19. Immigrants make up a majority of essential workers in places like New York City. New York City could pay to house its homeless population in hotel rooms currently sitting vacant but Mayor Bill de Blasio has absolutely to this point refused to do that. Says Wisconsin has not had a spike in coronavirus cases that was statistically significant related to the fact that they had voting. Beachgoers trash Florida beaches with 13000 pounds of litter after beaches reopen.
